GAMBLING GREG

Outcome:

            • Student will demonstrate the ability to create and use structs
  
            • Student will demonstrate the ability to create and use menus
  
            • Student will demonstrate the ability to create and use an
              array of structs
    
            • Student will demonstrate the ability to generate and use
              random numbers


Program Specifications:

  You are to assume that gambling Greg is going to the Dog Racing
  Track. Greg loves to bet on the puppies. In each race Greg will
  place a wager and pick a dog. The dog information will be stored
  in a structure name DOG as follows:
  
          Name

          amount to payout if Greg wins

          the odds of this dog winning the race.

  
Among other things or menus, the program will have the following
menu:

            [G]amble
  
            [B]anking
  
            [R]esults of each race that Greg wagered
  
            [L]eave the dog track
  
If Greg selects [G] the program will ask Greg for his wager and
allow Greg to pick a dog. The program will then run the races.
The result will be shown to Greg. The results of the race will be
stored for future use.

If Greg selects [B] the program will ask Greg if he wishes to
withdraw funds or deposit funds from his bank account.

If Greg selects [R] the program will show Greg the results of all
previous races.

If Greg selects [L] the program will end.


The dogs:

You will create 9 different dogs. See below:

          You name the dogs      2 to 1             40%
                                 5 to 1             10%
                                10 to 1              8%
                                15 to 1              6%
                                50 to 1              1%
                                20 to 1              4%
